# üí≥ Payment App ‚Äì Technical Challenge

This project is a **simple payment system** built for technical evaluation purposes.  
It demonstrates **user registration & login**, **role-based access**, and **transaction authorization rules** with a clean, modern frontend (Next.js 15) and Firebase backend.
